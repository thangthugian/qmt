        <br />I am a technology enthusiast and love to learn new things, I like
        the <br />
        way people strive to achieve their goals in life, not the brway they{" "}
        <br />
        share their achievements lavishly, I am not a perfect person but I
        always <br />
        try my best every day to become a better version than yesterday. Thank{" "}
        <br />

        in the near future so that everyone can refer to it and help me fix the{" "}
        <br />
        things I did not do right hihi. And also partly I want to record my
        learn <br />
        process during my university years, this is a long journey and I think{" "}
        <br />
        it will be a wonderful journey, I also hope everyone can interact with
